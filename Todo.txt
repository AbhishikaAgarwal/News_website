1) When a particular language is selected, then all the news should appear in that particular language.     
For now u can take a bunch of sample news for each category and make that basic framework.  
2) Make a sample about page as well. We'll change its content later. But for now, a sample about page is also required.
3) Add LinkedIn also with other social media handles.   👍
4) Give a little border radius to the search bar to make it look a little better.   👍
5) Change news positive to " The Times of The World "   👍
6) Try to use some function which adjusts the day and date according to the current day and date. If that's not possible now, then just remove that day and date.   👍

7) And below news positive, there are some categories like International, Teen, Sports and all, just take a bunch of news for each category and make a separate web page for all of them.  👍

8) And instead of this news heading from Rajasthan, take different pictures which can be from any of the sample news u took for point  and make them such that on clicking on a particular image, information related to that news should appear in a separate web page.   👍

9) Same goes with the auto-animation news as well. Once the user click on the image, news related to that image should come.
10) Take 2 different advertisements.    👍
11) From the news u took for point 7, pick up some latest , popular and trending news and place them in their respective categories in latest, popular and trending.
12) And for each category again the same, news should come on clicking on a particular headline.
13) And in each category, only 4 headlines with a 5th option as other should come and on clicking on other, all the news related to that category should come.      👍

14)Logout option when user logged in    👍
